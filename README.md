# Movie Review and Profile Analysis

![](https://github.com/igormcsouza/movie-review/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

## The aim

This project was born in my investigation on NLP area! The intent is to practice
and improve skills.

The project is very simple, a tool to get and predict people reviews about a 
random movie. The next step is to analise people profiles according to their
reviews.

## Tools

So far I'm using streamlit to run the backend and frontend easily! But, maybe
in the future, I'll move to flask and react as I'm used to them. Streamlit
so far is great, but, I'm too bound to its preset styles, there are not many 
tools to let change it myself, and that pisses me off.

On the prediction side, NLTK is taking place, to preprocess and prepare text to
be classified. I'm still deciding what I'm going to use on classification!
